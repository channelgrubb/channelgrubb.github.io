After leaving the comfy confines of academic philosophy, I served in the U.S. Navy as an officer aboard a nuclear-powered submarine - think Hunt for Red October. 

By day I work with data: statistics (I'm especially interested in Bayesian methods), machine learning, optimization and simulation models, risk modeling, and stochastic processes - to name a few recent project areas .

I hold an an M.Sc. in [Operations Research][1] and an M.A. in Philosophy.

...I still have a place in my heart for philosophy.
