After leaving the comfy confines of academic philosophy, I served in the U.S. Navy as an officer aboard a nuclear-powered submarine - think Hunt for Red October. By day I work with data: statistics (especially Bayesian methods), optimization models, machine learning, risk modeling, and stochastic processes - to name a few recent projects.

I hold an an M.Sc. in [Operations Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) and an M.A. in Philosophy. I enjoy writing, tackling statistics and machine learning puzzles, writing code, walking though the mountains, taking pictures of beautiful things, and reading.

...I still have a place in my heart for philosophy.
