After leaving the comfy confines of academic philosophy, I served in the U.S. Navy as a nuclear-powered submarine officer - think: Hunt for Red October. By day I work with data: statistics (especially Bayesian methods), machine learning, risk modeling, and stochastic processes - to name a few recent projects.

By night, I finished my M.S. in [Operations Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) - think applied mathematics - and have been working on my Ph.D. When I'm not doing any of the previous, I enjoy writing, tackling statistics and machine learning puzzles, writing code, walking though the mountains, taking pictures of beautiful things, and reading...I still have a place in my heart for philosophy.
