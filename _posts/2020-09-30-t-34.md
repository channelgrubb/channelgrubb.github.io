# T -34 days: The day after the “debate”  

The events of last nights “debate” left me feeling ashamed of what our democratic republic has exhibited in recent years. In particular, I remember the writers who have seen this kind of history play out before in places like Russia offering warnings to Americans in the wake of the 2016 Presidential elections. I reviewed some of those writings today. Here is the one that stood out to me at the time, and haunts me today
+ “[Autocracy: Rules for Survival][1]”, by [Masha Gessen][2] - it seems as relevant and prescient today as it did nearly four years ago.

## Reflecting on “The Election That Could Break America”  
My rumination has been recently fueled by [the piece in the The Atlantic by Barton Gellman about what could happen between November 4th, 2020 and the inauguration of the next President, during the _Interregnum_][3]. I’m citing this because it catalogues the kinds of risks we are facing in this election. Of course, the scenarios posed in this article may never come to pass, but they are real enough that some Americans are taking them seriously. This is the kind of story that one could look back on and say, “…we had warning signs; we could have seen this coming.” Of course, we could also look back on this as alarmism. And that’s the rub, we can’t know at this stage which future we will occupy, so we must do what we can, which means being aware of our risks and voting.  

## In the news  
+ Unsurprisingly, the debate was seen as an awful embarrassment
+ The President tries to clarify his message to the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by”, which has already made it onto Proud Boys merch
+ Senator Tim Scott offers a clear set of options on how to interpret President Trump
+ The [Coronavirus killed 751 Americans on September 29th, 2020][4]
