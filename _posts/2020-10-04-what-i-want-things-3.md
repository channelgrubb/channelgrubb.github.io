# The 5 Features Things Needs  

## Perennial Choices  
People practicing [Getting Things Done (GTD)][1] on iOS and Mac are seemingly perpetually wrestling with an enduring question: what is the best task management software to use for GTD?  

This is a great problem to have because it reflects how awesome the software options are. There are three main options: [OmniFocus][2], [Things][3], and [Todoist][4] [^1].  

After trying all three over the years, I'm pretty settled on Things. I like its simplicity, beautiful design, flexibility, and alignment with GTD methods.  

But it's not perfect. There are a few features it's missing that I find myself wanting on a nearly daily basis.  

## 1. Web interface  
In the world of GTD, the ‚Äòcapture‚Äô step is critical. Developing a habit of getting an action into your inbox is an important part of building trust in your system and its contents. Barriers to capture or friction in the capture process make reliable capture and trust in a GTD system harder to achieve.  

If I have my iPhone nearby, then capturing an action is quick: unlock my phone, long press on Things icon, select ‚ÄúNew To-Do,‚Äù and enter the item.  

Sometimes I don't have access to my phone but I do have access to a browser.  

Of course, I always have a notebook, and pen/pencil for capture. Web access, as OmniFocus realized, is a helpful capture tool as well as window into our next actions.  


## 2. Custom views / saved filters  
The quick find function in Things is great and I use it a lot. But occasionally I find myself wanting quicker access to the results of a common search. It would be great to have access to those custom, pre-saved views, so they are even easier and quicker to access. Task management needs to be easy, and this feature would make accessing my actions easier in many of my situations.

## 3. Section Headings in Areas  
Areas are great and they really help bring structure and simplicity to my system.  But there are two uses for Areas that  I would love to see. I‚Äôll cover the first one here.  

Section headings cannot be created at the Area level, only at the project level. I want to group my projects into headings within an area to show how the projects are related, and to smooth my weekly reviews.  

For example, I have many roles in my organization, but all of my work projects should fall within this broad area. Being able to organize my projects into my roles helps me to do two things: get a quick visual reference of my project burden by role, and support my weekly review.  

One could argue that such project clustering could be accomplished with Tags. True and I agree. But having organization and structure within the Area framework seems much more natural, and as we‚Äôve already covered, I can‚Äôt save Tag filters which makes discovery challenging. Now, if I could save Tag filters, then this might drop down the list.  

## 4. Notes section in Areas  
The second addition to Areas I would love to see is the addition of a notes section. Notes are a great way to capture some [^2] about my area, the headings (that I would love to write about), and any other information that might be relevant to an Area.  

## 6. Improved To-Do capture / entry  
Although I ultimately abandoned Todoist, there are some features that I was sad to say ‚Äògood bye‚Äô to. Chief among them was their parsing system for quick entry of to-do‚Äôs.  

The Todoist system uses special symbols that can be prepended to text to signify that it is a tag, set the priority of a to-do, and to quickly capture other helpful information.  

Things 3 requires me to enter text, tab to notes and type data, tab to start date and enter a date, tab to tags and type, then tab to due date and enter another date. Although my hands have adapted to tabbing, I would still like something to what Todoist offers to streamline the task entry process.

While I'm on this point, I'd like to lobby for Taskpaper support. üòä  

## 7. Collaboration  
This is an area where I‚Äôm actually deeply torn. For tasks associated with other people, Tags work well-enough for me. I can use a tag for ‚Äòwaiting‚Äô and a person‚Äôs name, and get all their outstanding tasks. So, I am good to go, right? Well, usually that‚Äôs true.  

As a dad, I need to assign some work every now and then. Although it‚Äôs great if I know that work exists, it is even better if my daughters know that work exists - especially when it is their task to complete. Being able to collaborate with them can be like GTD training wheels, and can also save some questions from me, which promotes peace.  

Admittedly, this is a feature that although I would use frequently, I wouldn‚Äôt use it forever. But the capability opens the door for Things to be a team tool. That could be nice, but it may not align to the vision of simplicity and focus that the app embodies.  

## 8. Markdown support in ‚ÄôNotes‚Äô area for projects  (and Areas ;))  
Markdown is very important to my writing habits. Being able to write in markdown is a real time saver and integrates with some of the other tools I have in place (think Text Expander).  

So, there you have it, my  5‚Ä¶er, 8 highest feature requests for Things. I love Things‚Äô simplicity and design, but I sometimes miss Todoist and OmniFocus. If history is a guide, then I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be experimenting again soon. :)

[^1]:	As an aside, the folks at Todoist have a really great blog that I really enjoy. It‚Äôs called [ambition&balance][5], and I really recommend that you check it out.
