# Why I read engineering data science blogs 

Data science and engineering blogs from companies like DoorDash, Uber, StichFix are great ways to keep up with the latest trends in data science being deployed at scale. Data science blogs from companies doing data science at scale offer glimpses into the tools, approaches, frameworks that these companies use to address their business problems.

But they offer something even more valuable: windows into what *aren't* problems that need addressing, tools and approaches that *aren't* useful.
