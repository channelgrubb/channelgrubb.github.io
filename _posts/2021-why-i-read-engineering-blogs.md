# Why I read engineering data science blogs 

Data science and engineering blogs from companies like DoorDash, Uber, StichFix are great ways to keep up with the latest trends in data science being deployed at scale. Data science blogs from companies doing data science at scale offer glimpses into the tools, approaches, frameworks that these companies use to address their business problems.

But they offer something even more valuable: windows into what *aren't* problems that need addressing, tools  that *aren't* useful, and approaches that *aren't* helpful. For me, I'm often reading to understand what methods aren't used when I read about the methods are. My reasoning is straight forward: data science teams are filled with smart people who need to make tough choices about what works and what doesn't, what is worth the time to implement and what isn't, what complexity can be tolerated and what complexity can't be, and so forth.

As the saying goes:
>It is good to learn from your mistakes. It is better to learn from others!

Let's see a few examples.

## DoorDash - Rule-Based Predictions and LightGBM

## Uber

## StichFix

As we can see, not only is there a lot to learn from what a data science team chose to do, but there is just as much to learn, if not more to learn from what they chose *not* to do.

## Lessons to carry forward
- Make deliberate decisions as a team, value debate and evidence-based argumentation.
- Don't rely on verbal exchanges, take the time to write down opinions, evidence, and reasoning. Remember, just because a teammate doesn't speak up in a meeting doesn't mean that they don'y have the best argument. It just means that the team hasn't heard it yet. Put differently, being the most eloquent doesn't make someone the most right. 
- Document the team's decisions and rationale, highlight decenting opinions and why their arguments didn't carry the day.
- Communicate what a data science team chooses to do and what they choose not to do under the assumptions
