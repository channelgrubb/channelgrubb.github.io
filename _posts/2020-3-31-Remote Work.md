# Remote Work

We’re all getting used to the realities imposed on us by the Coronavirus. Yesterday, the President announced that for the month April, Americans should minimize their travel. In my state of Virginia, the Governor issued a stay-at-home order with no expiration date to minimize the impacts of the SARS-nCoV-2019 (commonly being referred to as ‘coronavirus’, ‘COVID-19’). It’s tough to understand the impact of these moves in the present and will probably not fully wrap our heads around this event for years to come.

In the midst of this chaos, those of us fortunate enough to have a job that allows us to telework, have had to make that shift. For some companies or institutions (e.g. government agencies), this transition marks a major shift in the way we do business. Other companies are work remotely all the time, so this situation doesn’t present as many new challenges.

In an attempt to get better at remote work, I’m putting together some thoughts based on looking at three companies:
+ [Basecamp][1] (and their wonderful blog [Signal v noise][2])
+ [GitLab]()
+ [Automatic]()

Here are some of the highlight lessons
# Remote work is really work happening by people in different places or working at different times
When people talk about remote work, they often use words like ‘tele-commuting’ or ‘working from home’ or other weird phrases like ‘alternative work schedules.’

But remote work really boils down to people working in different places or in different times. Remote work really boils down to allowing people to maximize their freedom to choose when and where they get their work done.

Personally, I love the freedom to change my work locations, to wake up early and get work done before or as the sun rises. I love the freedom to wear something not so office-y, and really focus without the persistent threat of interruption all while sipping a home-made coffee.

But the point of work is getting things done, everything else is theater.

The ultimate challenge of any business is getting a group of individual people to act coherently to do or make something valuable.

When we think of work as something that happens at specific, narrowly-defined time (e.g. 8am to 9pm) and place (e.g. 123 Main St.) we lose sight of collective productive action. We tend to focus on being at a place for a time: attending the meeting, showing up on time, etc.

When working remotely, when the habits of going to a place at a time are disrupted, we can focus on working. For many knowledge workers who are working remotely, the question is how can work happening in place *A* at time *t*, line up to the work happening at Place *B*, at time *t’*.

Often times, the harmonization boils down to communicating.

# Remote work depends on good communication, and good communication depends on good (low context) writing
One the most striking insights from GitLab’s [remote work playbook][5]  is their emphasis on good communication, especially good writing. In their playbook, they also point out the need for ‘low context writing,’ i.e. writing in a way that allows people to understand even if they don’t have the kind of context that is often created through in-person interactions or being the primary person or people really working through a topic. I think we’ve all had the experience of coming to a code comment, report detail, briefing deck, or some other office artifact from 6 months that was incomplete in some way, only to ask: “So, what was the decision of that meeting?” Or, “But whyyyy did you choose those specific model parameters?”

Good low-context writing not only clearly expresses an idea or fact, but it also tells the reader why those ideas or facts matter. Low-context writing isn’t just writing for some unknown future teammate. It is writing for our future selves, so we can return to the work of our past selves and understand not only what we were doing, but what we were *thinking* and *why we were thinking those things.*



# Remote work doesn’t happen by accident

# Managing a transition is critical

# Use a small number of good tools that meet your needs
Ah, the endless debate over tools. The fact of the matter is that tools never make the maker, and as the saying goes, “only a poor craftsmen blames his tools.”

But none of those truisms imply that tools don’t matter at all. They do. As almost any painter, sculptor, writer, photographer, or programmer will tell you, tools can matter tremendously. The goal of any of our tool choices should be to find the smallest number of tools that meet our needs. This tool chest “should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.” **FOOTNOTE**

Many teams have had the experience of having important project information sprinkled over a multitude of tools: email, network file storage, code repo, Jira and Confluence…it feels like chaos because it is chaos. The goal for work in general is to find the smallest set of tools that meet the mission and jealously guard that simplicity and effectiveness. Unfortunately, the default toolset of email and network file storage is a long rope that people can tie a very effective noose with. One need to look no farther than that document we’ve all seen to know our situation’s outlook looks bleak: ‘meeting-final-v21-jan152012-peter-final-final.pptx’


# Don’t let work consume your life; set physical and time boundaries
It is tempting in the midst of this crisis to calm our nerves with work. Sometimes being busy is better than being quiet with nothing but our anxiety about a global pandemic to occupy our thoughts.

# Make time to connect socially with friends and colleagues
The term social distancing has unfortunately gained traction before a more thoughtful, or helpful phrase could be found to take its place. ‘Physical distancing’ is more apt. We should be staying 6ft (or 1 fathom) away from other humans, but we should be socially coming together using all of this great (although certainly not perfect) technology.

Today, for example, 5 of us were on a video call. We were talking for about 5 minutes before we heard the screams and yells of ‘an angry Elsa.’ She politely excused herself, muted her microphone, and left the room to tend to her young daughter. She came back and before too long, a half-naked 4 year old came in with a pacifier in her mouth to sit with her mommy. It was adorable. As a dad of two daughters, I could relate to that. After seeing her as a mother, I felt like I knew my coworker better, on a more human level. It was refreshing, even if stressful for her.
