title: It's Been Awhile
---

I want to write more and share at least some of it publicly. 

Why? A few reasons:
+ the need to work through complex ideas by breaking them down into a series of simpler steps that I can explain.
+ the desire to share ideas with others so that they might be able to learn something, or to provoke a thought, or to demonstrate a way to think about something.
+ to set aside time to cultivate my own thinking and ability to express myself.
+ to move more slowly, to develop a greater capacity to be patient and dilligent enough to work through ideas.
+ to leave breadcrumbs along my way to things that I found compelling enough to spend time writing about. The internet is a vast sea of information and it is always a delight to find helpful or insightful, well-written information. Hopefully I can add a little to that goodness.

So, consider this a first step. I'd like to start with a sustainable pace, maybe a post per week. The important thing for me is the consistency.
