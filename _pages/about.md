I am a data scientist who lives in the Washington, DC area. I like to write about data science, practical and natural philosophy, productivity, and other things that make life more enjoyable.

In a previous life, I was a U.S. nuclear submarine officer, serving in the Western Pacific.

Thanks for reading!
